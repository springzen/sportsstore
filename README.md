SportStore
===========

## 2014.05.27
Book project from the book by Adam Freeman - the book link at Amazon: [http://amzn.com/B00HX4PJ9I]
Essentially, this project starts at Chapter 6 where the 'real' book project starts.
Each chapter is branched so if you mess up, you can always get back to the initial state.

I have also added the file to start the project in "server" mode using node. If you create the project in a folder named sprtsstore, copy sport.js outside the sportsstore folder and start it using node as in "node sport.js" this will create a simple webserver to allow you to start this project and view it on your browser using this url: http://localhost:5001/app.html - if you open sport.js you will notice the port definition in there.

I have created the project using WebStorm; and so I added the project files as well.

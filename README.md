book project from the book by Adam Freeman - the book link at Amazon: amzn.com/B00HX4PJ9I
Essentially, the project starts at Chapter 6 where the 'real' project starts in the book.
Each chapter is branched so if you mess up, you can always get back to the initial state.

I have created the project using Webstorm; and so I added the projec files as well.
